<h1 align="center">Landing on your Feet: Life after the layoff?</h1>



<p><b>An Illustrative Example: A Live Discord Community Supporting Those Impacted by the 2023 Technology Layoffs</b></p>
<p>This repo outlines the formation of a support group, comprised of individuals affected by the recent technology layoffs in 2023 from an individual company, and how they are supporting each other in their job search efforts.  A discord template is provided to make this easily reproducible for others.</p>

## Why companies should get involved and foster these communities
<ul>
<li><b>Better Company Image:</b> By handling layoffs in a professional and humane manner, companies can maintain a positive image in the eyes of their employees, former employees, and the general public. This can help to attract top talent and improve brand reputation, which can have a positive impact on future business prospects.</li>
<li><b>Increased Productivity:</b> When layoffs are handled smoothly, remaining employees are less likely to be distracted by the stress and negativity that can come from in-fighting and low morale. This can help to maintain a more productive and positive work environment, which can lead to improved results and increased profitability.</li>
<li><b>Improved Employee Retention:</b> Companies that handle layoffs with care and compassion are more likely to retain their best employees. This can help to reduce the costs associated with hiring and training new employees, and can improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the organization. Additionally, employees who feel valued and respected are more likely to be engaged and motivated, which can lead to increased productivity and a stronger company culture.

<h2>I. Gather the Troops</h2>
   <p>Maintaining culture, morale, and community even after a layoff is crucial for both the remaining employees and those who were laid off. Layoffs can be a traumatic and stressful experience, leading to feelings of uncertainty, loss, and betrayal. However, by fostering a sense of community and support, both groups can mitigate the negative impact of layoffs and even turn the experience into an opportunity for growth and development.  Step 1 is to gather those affected into a group, whether through linkedin, slack, or whatsapp. We will refer to this group as “GroupX”.</p>
   
<h2>II. Utilizing Messaging Platforms</h2>
    <p>Use of messaging apps like Slack and Discord can provide a space for individuals to connect, share information, and offer support to one another. Sharing job openings and referral networks can provide an additional avenue for job searching.  See below for a walkthrough on how to replicate this process using a prebuilt Discord Template.  Step 2, gather all of those people into one messaging platform like Discord or Slack.</p>
    <h2>III. Cathartic Discussions and Creativity</h2>
    <p>Cathartic discussions can allow individuals to process and cope with their emotions related to the layoff. Discussing new startup ideas can foster a sense of creativity and innovation, and provide a new focus for those who have been laid off. Step 3, create a safe environment for people to share what is on their minds, their experience, and ideas.</p>
<h2>IV. Practical Support</h2>
    <p>Sharing financial advice, sharing contact information, fast networking, communicating as one voice, and clarifying layoff severance details can be valuable for those who have been laid off. Reviewing each other's resumes and helping each other provide and survive can be a powerful way to bind together and provide practical assistance to those in need.  Step 4, start developing lanes for practical support to be provided from within the group's collective working knowledge. i.e. How to start a business or how to use chatgpt or building business networks or sharing accountant's information</p>
<h2>V. Boosting Morale</h2>
    <p>Finding humor in the negative situation and celebrating small wins can boost morale and create a positive and resilient community. Providing a safe place for individuals to unwind and socialize, learning new skills, and supporting each other in interview preparation can be beneficial. A shared passion for video games, or a cute picture of a pet can save someone’s day.</p>
<h2>VI. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, it is essential to preserve the group culture, morale, and sense of community after a layoff.  There is clear strength in numbers that can ease the strain and sting of unemployment.  Those let go must combine and remain as one group, one voice. By providing emotional support, practical assistance, and creating a supportive community through shared resources, individuals can not only reduce the adverse effects of layoffs but also turn it into an opportunity for personal growth and development. </p>

 <p>   The following is a working example of how a group of laid off workers can rely on one another to arrive safely on the other side of unemployment.</p>
## Why Discord and How to setup from scratch:
<p>Discord is a voice, and text-based chat program used most often in the gaming community.  It is free and easily accessible to all.  It allows video and voice chat for free with huddles and all of the text functionality of slack.</p>  
<p>It is broken down into levels.  First, there is the server, where all channels and members are housed.  Next are channel sections.  These sections can be configured to maintain privacy/security and add organization to the channels housed under them.  Lastly are the channels.  Whether they are text or voice channels, these are the spaces people can access and converse based on their roles.  Channels can inherit their security settings from their corresponding section or can have their own permissions configured by a server administrator.</p>

#### If you are new to Discord you can register here: [Discord Registration](https://discord.com/register)

#### If you already know how to use discord, please feel free to use the following template and skip ahead to the permissions.  Otherwise, to create your own discord and follow along, please follow this link: [Discord Template](https://discord.new/K37JsQethnJE) 

<p>If clicking the template link above does not prompt you to create a discord server automatically, to create a discord server from a template link, you can follow these steps:</p>
