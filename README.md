<h1 align="center">Landing on our Feet: What happens after the layoff?</h1>

<h2>I. Gather the Troops</h2>
   <p>Maintaining culture, morale, and community even after a layoff is crucial for both the remaining employees and those who were laid off. Layoffs can be a traumatic and stressful experience, leading to feelings of uncertainty, loss, and betrayal. However, by fostering a sense of community and support, both groups can mitigate the negative impact of layoffs and even turn the experience into an opportunity for growth and development.  Step 1 is to gather those affected into a group, whether through linkedin, slack, or whatsapp. We will refer to this group as “MemberX”.</p>
   <p><b>Below is a real example based on a live Discord currently servicing a group of individuals affected by the most recent tech layoffs of 2023.</b></p>
    <h2>II. Utilizing Messaging Platforms</h2>
    <p>Use of messaging apps like Slack and Discord can provide a space for individuals to connect, share information, and offer support to one another. Sharing job openings and referral networks can provide an additional avenue for job searching.  See below for a walkthrough on how to replicate this process using a prebuilt Discord Template.  Step 2, gather all of those people into one messaging platform like Discord or Slack.</p>
    <h2>III. Cathartic Discussions and Creativity</h2>
    <p>Cathartic discussions can allow individuals to process and cope with their emotions related to the layoff. Discussing new startup ideas can foster a sense of creativity and innovation, and provide a new focus for those who have been laid off. Step 3, create a safe environment for people to share what is on their minds, their experience, and ideas.</p>
    <h2>IV. Practical Support</h2>
    <p>Sharing financial advice, sharing contact information, fast networking, communicating as one voice, and clarifying layoff severance details can be valuable for those who have been laid off. Reviewing each other's resumes and helping each other provide and survive can be a powerful way to bind together and provide practical assistance to those in need.  Step 4, start developing lanes for practical support to be provided from within the group's collective working knowledge. i.e. How to start a business or how to use chatgpt or building business networks or sharing accountant's information</p>
    <h2>V. Boosting Morale</h2>
    <p>Finding humor in the negative situation and celebrating small wins can boost morale and create a positive and resilient community. Providing a safe place for individuals to unwind and socialize, learning new skills, and supporting each other in interview preparation can be beneficial. A shared passion for video games, or a cute picture of a pet can save someone’s day.</p>
    <h2>VI. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, it is essential to preserve the group culture, morale, and sense of community after a layoff.  There is clear strength in numbers.  Those let go must combine and remain as one group, one voice. By providing emotional support, practical assistance, and creating a supportive community through shared resources, individuals can not only reduce the adverse effects of layoffs but also turn it into an opportunity for personal growth and development.</p>

<h2>Example Using Discord</h2>

#### If you already know how to use discord, please feel free to use the following template and skip ahead to the permissions.  Otherwise, to create your own discord and follow along, please follow this link: [Discord Template](https://discord.new/Q6hCwuZPyhbT) 

<p>If clicking the link above does not prompt you to create a discord server automatically, to create a discord server from a template link, you can follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to your Discord account.</li>
  <li>Click on the "Server Templates" button on the Discord Homepage.</li>
  <li>Enter the template link in the "Import from a Code" section.</li>
  <li>Click on the "Import" button.</li>
  <li>Customize your server as desired and invite your friends to join.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: You'll need to have the "Server Template" feature enabled on your Discord account to use this feature.</p>




## Why Discord and How to setup for Discord from scratch:
<p>Discord is a voice, and text-based chat program used most often in the gaming community.  It is free and easily accessible to all.  It allows video and voice chat for free with huddles and all of the text functionality of slack.</p>  
<p>It is broken down into levels.  First, there is the server, where all channels and members are housed.  Next are channel sections.  These sections can be configured to maintain privacy/security and add organization to the channels housed under them.  Lastly are the channels.  Whether they are text or voice channels, these are the spaces people can access and converse based on their roles.  Channels can inherit their security settings from their corresponding section or can have their own permissions configured by a server administrator.</p>


## For this application, the following role types are recommended: 
#### Administrator
  - A full admin that can see every channel in discord, set up permissions, create/delete channels, configure bots, and be the adjudicator as needed.
#### Hiring-Ally
  - A hiring-ally is someone from outside of the layoff group who wishes the reach out to the layoff group to help in any way possible.  So far, this group has included recruiters, employees still with the previous employer, friends from the memberx's networks and hiring managers.
#### Memberx (Can be any unique Name)
  - A memberx would have the broadest access without having full admin access.  This role is reserved for memberx’s of the layoff group.
## For this application, the following channel categories are recommended.
#### Public to All - Allies and Alumni Chat
  - A fully public section available to all that join the server.
#### Private - General
  - A section for private conversations to take place, ideas to be shared in a safe environment, new skills to be learned, referrals to be given,and for new nominations to the group to be made.
#### Private - Finding a Gig
  - A section for interview preparation, success, and leads on companies hiring.
#### Private - Social
  - A space for catharsis, gaming, networking, and sharing your pets and hobbies.
#### Private - Voice Channels
  - A section for interview preparation, success, and leads on companies hiring.
